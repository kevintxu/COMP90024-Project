## Sentiment Analysis

An existing sentiment analyser formulated for Social Media research was used to establish a baseline sentiment for all the available tweet data.
The specific analyser (VADER - _Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner_) is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool. 
The tool was choosen as is specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media. 

Configuration and code from multiple sources (https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment  and  https://github.com/codingupastorm/vadersharp) 
were merged.  A number of performance issue where addressed with the available implementations.

The analyser is capability generating  scores from multiple perspectives.
The **compound** score  provides a single unidimensional measure of sentiment for a given sentence.
The compound score is computed by summing the valence scores of each word in the lexicon, 
adjusted according to the rules, and then normalized to be between -1 (most extreme negative) 
and +1 (most extreme positive). 

It can be used standardized thresholds for classifying sentences as either positive, neutral, or negative. 
Typical threshold values (used with approach) are:

* positive sentiment: compound score >= 0.05
* neutral sentiment: (compound score > -0.05) and (compound score < 0.05)
* negative sentiment: compound score <= -0.05

 
Specifically, the scoring  process:
 
It covers all features we are meant to address:

* scores word for positive & negative associations (e.g. awesome +)  (e.g. dickhead -)  
* increased  sentiment with capitalised words (e.g. I LOVE my dog,  I HATE you)  
* increased positive sentiment for !!!!!   
* understands some double negatives (e.g. not bad)   
* understand old smiles   : )   ):<     - it has prescribed weighting for each of these combinations.  
* understands  emojis   ❤💞😊💙   -  emojis are converted to word equivalents before sentiment analysis is applied
  e.g. 😊   becomes _"smiling face with smiling eyes"_
